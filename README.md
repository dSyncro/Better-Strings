# Better-Strings
C++ String implementation with extra functions compared to std::string

## Purposes of this library

The main aim of this library is to provide a custom implementation of string, easier to use compared to the std one (not necessary faster).

## Getting Started

This library is very easy to use as it syntax is pretty similar to the standard c++ one.

```cpp
string a = "Hello";
s += ' ';

string b = "World!";

std::cout << (a + b) << std::endl;

// Output is 'Hello World!'
```

But it has also many improvements, for example:

```cpp
string s = "Hello ";

std::cout << (s * 4) << std::endl;

// Output is 'Hello Hello Hello Hello'
```
